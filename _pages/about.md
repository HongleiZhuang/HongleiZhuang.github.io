Welcome to my homepage! I am a Research Scientist at [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/). My general research interests include information retrieval, natural language processing, data mining and machine learning. Specifically, I have been working on a variety of topics covering text ranking and text mining using large language models (LLMs). Before I joined Google, I obtained my PhD from [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) and my bachelor's degree from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/index.htm).
