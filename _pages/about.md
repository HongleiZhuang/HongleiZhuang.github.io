Welcome to my homepage! I currently work at [Google Research](https://research.google/). My general research interests include data mining, machine leanring and information retrieval. Specifically, I have been working on a variety of topics covering text mining, outlier detection, crowdsourcing and social network analysis. Before I joined Google, I obtained my PhD from [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) and my bachelor's degree from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/index.htm).
